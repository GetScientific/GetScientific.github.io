    <p class="sectiontag text-big">Learn About Black Holes</p>
    <p class="sectionsubtag text-small" >Black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe, and they are wildly weird and complicated. 
        First, we will talk about what is space and time, space and time are the grand stage where the play of the universe folds. But space is not a fixed stage and time does not tick the same for everyone everywhere. In short, they are relative. Matter bents space and bent space tells matter how to move. Put some planets and stars on the stage and it sags underneath them. That misshapen stage, with all its little wraps and dips give us gravity.
        Black holes do not just bend the stage, they are like trap doors. Places with so much mass that the universe formed a ‘no-go’ stage where the laws change. Most black holes form when very massive stars die. 
        The event horizon of a black hole is the point of no return. Anything that passes this point will be swallowed by the black hole and forever vanish from our known universe. At the event horizon, the black hole's gravity is so powerful that no amount of mechanical force can overcome or counteract it.
        The singularity at the centre of a black hole is the ultimate no man's land: a place where matter is compressed down to an infinitely tiny point, and all conceptions of time and space completely break down. And it does not really exist.
